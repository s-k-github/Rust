ENUM:
    enum is short for enumeration
    Used to define a type that can be one of several named variants
    Each variant can represent different kinds of data
    Capable of storing structured data
    Fully integrated into the language’s match system
    Enables clean control flow without flags or type-checking hacks
Rust doesn't need just a switch — it gives you enum + match, which is much safer, more powerful, and expressive.

Types of enum:
    1. Basic
    2. With message/data
    3. option enum
